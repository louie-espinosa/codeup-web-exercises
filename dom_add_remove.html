        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {

//             When the user clicks the "Add Todo" button, add a new Todo card as a child of the div with id my-todos.
//
// The text in the input with id add-todo-text should be the text of the newly added todo.
// The new todo MUST have a button (or something similar) labeled "Delete Todo". When a delete button is clicked, it deletes the todo in which the button is contained.
// Whenever a new todo is created, you must add an event listener to the new delete button that will call the deleteTodo function.
// Use the HTML of the starting todo in the code as a model for additional todos.
// There are a couple of ways you can add the todo. i. use document.createElement() and work with DOM element references. This is kind of a long way as there are several
// embedded divs. ii. concatenate the HTML text of the new card to the innerHTML of my-todos. This way is very simple BUT you can't modify the elements until after
// the innerHTML property is changed AND you will have to re-add the click listener for ALL the todos. Setting the innerHTML property of my-todos removes the previous listeners.
//
// When a todo's delete button is clicked, it removes the todo div (i.e., the card) in which the button is contained.
//
// Use DOM traversal to delete the card containing the clicked button. Because we used a pretty Bootstrap card for the todo, we have travel a little ways up the DOM tree
// to get at the delete button's containing card!
// IMPORTANT: Be sure to add the delete button listener to the first todo that is already in the DOM when the page loads!
//
// Let's modularize the code nicely. Put all of the code responsible for creating a new todo in the function called addTodo and all the code responsible for deleting
// a todo in the function called deleteTodo. Your handlers will call those functions. You don't need to pass anything into addTodo. Use the automatically provided
// event parameter in deleteTodo to get a reference to the delete button that clicked. Use event.target for that.

            function addTodo() {
                //add your code here
            }

            function deleteTodo(event) {

            }

        });

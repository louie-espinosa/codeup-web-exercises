<!--    Under the FAQ, add 3 unordered lists like above. Each list should contain a national park name in an h3 element, and a ul of 4 facts about the park.-->
<h1>Parks List</h1>
<div id="pp-div">
    <h3 id="pp-heading">Pineapple on Pizza Controversy</h3>
    <ul id="pineapple-pizza">
        <li>Some are against the idea as it originated in Canada</li>
        <li>First of all, it is scientifically proven that pineapple belongs on pizza.</li>
        <li>Carlsbad Caverns</li>
        <li>Denali</li>

<div id="color-view-div">
    <h3 id="color-view-heading">Tetrachromacy and color blindness</h3>
    <ul id="color-view">
        <li>Humans are trichromatic and can see short, middle, and long wavelenghts</li>

        <li>Dogs and most mammals are dichromatic and see much less colors</li>

        <li>Some birds, fish, butterflies, and bees are tetrachromats and can see many millions of colors.
            These Tetrachromats have four types of photoreceptors, and can even see colors in the UV spectrum</li>

        <li>The genes responsible for two of our receptors, or cones are found in the x chromosome which is why color-blindness occurs mostly in men.</li>

</div>
<div id="oxygen-cancer-div">
    <h3 id="oxygen-cancer-heading">Oxygen and cancer</h3>
    <ul id="oxygen-cancer">
        <li>In 1931 Dr. Warburg won his first Nobel Prize for proving cancer is caused by a lack of oxygen respiration in cells.
            He stated in an article titled "The Prime Cause and Prevention of Cancer... the cause of cancer is no longer a mystery,
            we know it occurs whenever any cell is denied 60% of its oxygen requirements..." </li>

        <li>Summarized in a few words, the prime cause of cancer is the replacement of the respiration of oxygen in normal body cells by a fermentation of sugar.</li>

        <li>Fermentation allows these cells to survive, but they can no longer perform any functions in the body or communicate
            effectively with the body. Consequently, these cells can only multiply and grow. And may become cancerous.
            Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say, they degrade into cancer cells that no longer serve your body, but live to survive...</li>

        <li>Lack of nutrients in cells is the main cause of poor cellular oxygen metabolism. If our testing is correct, this is the case about 75% of the time.
            It starts with pathogens. Specifically, large pathogens that produce many toxins.
            Mostly this pathogen is Candida. Mold or other fungi, and Lyme bacterium could also be the cause.
            It is mostly from Candida because of the introduction of antibiotics many decades ago. These destroy friendly bacteria but not Candida.
            So it overgrows in the intestinal tract and spreads throughout the body.</li>
